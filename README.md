# Vaccination_Management_System
The Spring Boot application is designed to maintain records of doctors, users, centers, doses given to users, and appointment bookings. 
It provides 15 APIs for various operations. The application consists of several entities, including Doctor, User, Center, Dose, and Appointment, each with 
specific attributes to capture relevant information. Controllers and endpoints are used to expose the functionality as RESTful APIs.

1) The DoctorController manages operations related to doctors, such as retrieving a list of doctors, creating new doctors, updating doctor details,
   and deleting doctors.
2) The UserController handles similar operations for users, while the CenterController focuses on centers.
3) The DoseController manages doses, allowing users to retrieve dose information, add new doses, update dose details, and remove doses.
4) the AppointmentController handles appointment-related operations, including retrieving appointment details, creating new appointments, updating appointments, and canceling appointments.

Services handle the business logic, while repositories interact with the underlying database, which can be a relational database like MySQL. 
This low-level design provides a solid foundation for building a Spring Boot application to manage doctors, users, centers, doses, and appointments, 
with room for further customization and expansion based on specific requirements.
